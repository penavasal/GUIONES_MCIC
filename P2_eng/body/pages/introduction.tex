\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction} The goals of this
practice are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reinforce the practical concepts associated with (i) the
  numerical analysis by the finite element method and (ii) the use of
  the Abaqus program.
\item Review the problem of stationary diffusion, its numerical
  resolution and apply these concepts to the problem of fluid flow in a porous
  medium.
\end{enumerate}

The practice consists of three sections:
\begin{description}
\item[Section 1.] Brief introduction to the problem of steady-state fluid flow in a
  porous medium.
\item[Section 2.] Description of the finite element analysis procedure
  of a steady state diffusion problem with the Abaqus program.
\item[Section 3.] Four exercises to be solved by the student.
\end{description}
