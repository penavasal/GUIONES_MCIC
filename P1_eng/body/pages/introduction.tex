\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction} The goals of this practical class are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To introduce the applied concepts associated with numerical analysis by the finite element method.
\item To introduce the use of the finite element program Abaqus$^\circledR$ (version \textit{Interactive}) by simulating a linear problem.

\end{enumerate}
The practice consists of two sections:
\begin{description}
\item[Section 1.] Description of the finite element analysis procedure of a linear mechanical problem with the Abaqus$^\circledR$  program.
\item[Section 2.] A exercise proposed to be solved by the student.
\end{description}
